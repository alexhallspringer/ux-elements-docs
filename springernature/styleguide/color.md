# Colour

Colour plays an important role in contributing to the character and identity of the Springer Nature visual style. Our colour system applies a core palette globally, to create a cohesive user experience for all our brands. Brand specific colours are used as an accent, such as highlighting top stories and illustrations.

## Accessbility
The colour system is designed to be accessible. Springer Nature is committed to ensuring our products and services are usable by the largest possible audience. This includes people with visual, hearing, cognitive or motor impairments. We support WCAG 2.1 level AA which requires 4.5:1 contrast for text.


Some people are colour blind or perceive colours differently, so do not rely entirely on colour to communicate things the user needs to know. 

To help understand the impact of colour, try using a [color-blind simulator](https://colororacle.org/) to desaturate your design. You can also decrease the reliance on colour by using icons, text labels and always making sure text links are underlined.


## Colour palette
We are currently working on generating design tokens on the Elements website. You can view our list of colours [on our sketch styleguide](https://www.sketch.com/s/fa9c2fc9-a179-43f0-b21e-9562c9c17c0c/a/Ompxge8).

## Addition of a serif

When our company was created, a single sans serif typeface (Daytona) was selected as our primary brand font, used exclusively for marketing communications. When we started working on digital research products directly under the Springer Nature brand name, it quickly became apparent that one font is not enough. The complex user interface functionality and density of scholarly content in our digital products requires a variety of font styles and weights to convey the appropriate hierarchy of information.

A single font is not enough to help users distinguish between elements such as headings, body text, instructional text, supporting text, data input, form labels, error messaging and validation. A serif font paired up with a sans serif font can give us that visual variety and design flexibility.

Following experimentation, weâ€™ve identified Merriweather as a serif font for our product needs. We conducted an online survey (1357 participants, details available upon request) to evaluate Merriweather in comparison to Daytona, which showed us that Merriweather performs equally well as Daytona in terms of brand perception, ensuring it is an appropriate addition to the Springer Nature brand.

Serif fonts are typically associated with tradition, heritage, authority. Our research has shown that serif fonts are particularly suited for academic content, as they help convey trust, reliability, credibility and can aid readability & accessibility. For this reason, we decided to make Merriweather our primary product font, paired with Daytona as our secondary, supporting font.

# Layout
## Grid

We’ve designed a simple, robust and flexible grid, based on current use cases.

## Page Archetypes

We currently have a simple page for general use, such as leaf level (1), a discovery page with teaser cards, for example a product homepage (2), and a search results page with filters (3), which is a common design pattern in databases.

These are essential design patterns we’ve identified so far. Bear in mind you can mix and match components to create variations of these. We’ll be adding more page archetypes as we work on new use cases through product development.

# Imagery

Our products have the option of adapting abstract photography from our research catalogue, to create subtly branded page headers, as well as editorial imagery, to help add context to the content. The full image library can be found in our brand hub on Hive.

## An integrated brand approach to imagery

Launched in September 2017, Springer Nature Experiments was the first product to bring together the Springer and Nature brands. The platform went live while the branding team was still busy writing the next chapter of the Springer Nature brand. Having established the Springer Nature Research Publisher brand identity, the logical next step was to apply the new branding strategy to our publishing solutions that were bringing together products from stand-alone imprint brands under the Springer Nature brand.

Gathering content from Nature (Nature Methods, Nature Protocols, Protocols Exchange) and Springer (SpringerProtocols), Springer Nature Experiments was one of these research solutions adding value to researchers and helping us build recognition as a respected and progressive research publisher. As such, Springer Nature Experiments logo was revised to align with the new branding guidelines for publishing solutions logos, where the solution’s name is emphasized to draw attention to the solution’s role or key benefits.

The next step was to apply the branding to the platform itself and that’s where UX and marketing came together to create a new look and feel for Experiments that lives within the branding guidelines while still retaining a distinct identity for the platform.

Springer Nature publishing solutions use colours from the main colour palette and the Emerald was chosen for Experiments. UX and Marketing however decided to go beyond the colouring and create a visual identity for the product itself that would carry through from the platform to the marketing materials in order to build brand recognition. Several brainstorming sessions helped select specific brand assets that could support Experiments positioning throughout all its brand manifestations. Any new assets would have to work across all of the users’ touchpoints and be consistent across the digital solution itself through to print collaterals, digital materials or conference items.

To reflect Experiments’ positioning as a unique solution for life science researchers and in line with our Subject Matter Experts recommendations, a microscope view of cells was applied to the Emerald design. We hope you agree with us that this new design not only represents an attractive look and feel for the platform but also strengthens Experiments’ unique brand identity within the Springer Nature publishing solutions.

It is also worth noting that supporting images of people and details were added to the Experiments brand toolkit to help bring the brand to life throughout different media. And the Brand Team will be updating the brand guidelines later this year with the new visuals (the current version contains the old ones). While the platform has been updated with this new design, a complete overall of Experiments collaterals is now in progress to reflect these changes. The new brand assets and templates will also be available within Marketing Services.

# Accessibility

## What is accessibility?
Accessibility is the practice of designing products and services to be usable by all people. This includes people with vision, hearing, cognitive or motor impairments. Designing for accessibility also creates positive benefits for all users. For example, high contrast, readable text makes it easier to read on a phone in bright sunlight.

Ensuring our websites are accessible is the responsibility of everyone at Springer Nature. It is also required by law in many countries where we do business. As a research publisher, we have a duty to make human knowledge accessible for people with all abilities.

To make sure products are accessible to everyone, follow the  [four principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head) :
1. **Perceivable:** It can be perceived by at least one of a person’s senses.
2. **Operable:** All interactions are operable through a variation of input methods.
3. **Understandable:** Information and operation of the interface must be understandable. 
4. **Robust:** Content can be interpreted by a variety of assistive technologies and withstand changes in these technologies.

## Use alternative (alt) text on images
We use alt text to describe the appearance and function of an image on a page. It’s a textual alternative to non-text content.

### What’s it for?
1. Alt text is a key principle of web accessibility. Visually impaired users using screen readers will be read an alt attribute to better understand an image. Images without an alt attribute, or with inappropriate alt text, are likely inaccessible.
2. Alt text displays in place of an image if an image file can’t be loaded.
3. Alt text can be crawled by search engines, helping them to index a page properly.

### What isn’t it for?
Alt text is not the same as caption text. Caption text adds additional context to an image, but doesn’t describe the image content.
Alt text isn’t for describing the design or layout of the page. Text like “main graphic” isn’t useful to describe an image. 

### How to write alt text
There isn’t a hard and fast rule. The alt text for a particular image may change depending on the context, and what kind of content the image is used within. Follow these principles when writing alt text:
* Don’t say ‘Image of…’ or ‘Picture of…’ etc.
* Don’t repeat information already given in the text on the page.
* Keep it short – 125 characters or less if possible (some screen-readers cut off alt text after this point).
* Copyright info, image source, or other extra information should go in the caption, not the alt text.
* Context is important e.g. it may be appropriate to note if an image is a photo or an artwork, whether a person is old or young, if the sky is stormy or clear, if that is relevant to the content. 
* Think about how you would describe the image to a person who can’t see it.

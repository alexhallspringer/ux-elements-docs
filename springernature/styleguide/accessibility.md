## What is accessibility?
Accessibility is the practice of designing products and services to be usable by people with disabilities. These can include those with vision, hearing, cognitive or motor impairments. Designing for accessibility also creates positive benefits for all users. For example, high contrast, readable text makes it easier to read on a phone in bright sunlight.

Ensuring our websites are accessible is the responsibility of everyone at Springer Nature. It is also required by law in many countries where we do business. As a research publisher, we have a duty to make human knowledge accessible for people with all abilities.

To make sure products are accessible to everyone, follow the  [four principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head) :
1. **Perceivable:** It can be perceived by at least one of a personâ€™s senses.
2. **Operable:** All interactions are operable through a variation of input methods.
3. **Understandable:** Information and operation of the interface must be understandable. 
4. **Robust:** Content can be interpreted by a variety of assistive technologies and withstand changes in these technologies.

# Branding

 The header area sets the tone for our product branding and overall look & feel. We’ve adapted and extended the Springer Nature brand and design principles, as originally established in our marketing website, to cater for digital products with more complex use cases.

Header branding example for Springer Nature Products

The header area consists of 3 full-width elements: a white strip for the product logo and primary navigation, a thin colour strip, and a deep page header, following the same brand colour theme as the strip. On our marketing site, this holds the primary marketing message. On a product interface, a visually busy header would distract the user from focusing on key tasks, adding visual overload.

That is why we have altered the header’s dynamic, we’ve made it visually calmer, simpler. Its primary purpose now is signposting and to act as a branded background, allowing us to prioritise product functionality, guiding the user’s eye into the page content. We’ve developed a set of brand colour gradients to support this visual hierarchy with a depth of field, focusing the user experience on the foreground page content.

Our brand colour themes enable us to construct a flexible design system that can lend a sense of sub-branding to each product, and at the same time create a cohesive product suite that is distinctly Springer Nature. The individual product identity is further strengthened by the logo lockup, emphasising the product title, endorsed by the Springer Nature logo. The product name is set in Merriweather, our primary font for digital products.

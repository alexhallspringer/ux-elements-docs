This design toolkit sets the core principles of our creative direction, to help our globally distributed teams build brand-compliant products with a unified, consistent look & feel, that is distinctly Springer Nature.

Springer Nature is a global academic publisher, under which sits a portfolio of flagship brands and imprints, with the aim of advancing discovery and serving the needs of the scientific community. To help add value to the community and build recognition, our brand strategy has identified the need to create publishing solutions directly under the Springer Nature brand name. These are digital products that curate and package content from across our flagship brands and imprints, as well as standalone tools and services.

Our UX Design team has worked collaboratively with Brand and Marketing to adapt our initial marketing design guidelines and extend these for the complex interaction needs of digital product development, allowing the company to grow in this direction.

Currently this toolkit only provides visual aids to the development of a Springer Nature product, it is not a code library. We currently donâ€™t supply the CSS for the components, so please contact Andy Lim or Luke Stavenhagen for any questions about styling detail.

With the help of our frontend team, this design toolkit will evolve to become a living design system of shareable code, ensuring brand consistency and design best practices are effectively applied across the organisation, reducing duplication of effort, for truly efficient product development. Until we are in a position to release shareable code, developers should follow the guidelines laid out in the Frontend Playbook and contact the frontend team for clarification on code decisions.

## When to use
You can use this element to display download links. 

## When not to use
This element is _**not**_ a <select> element. 
Styling options for <select> elements with CSS are limited. Therefore, highly customised visual designs for <select> require building the element from scratch using Javascript. While creating a custom <select> element is technically _possible_, recreating the accessibility and usability of the native browser element is time consuming and difficult to get right. As such, the native <select> element should be used. As this approach comes with visual design constraints, consider pairing with a frontend developer when designing a <select> element.

# Introduction

These guidelines help us keep our digital content consistent across our products, platforms and services. This includes:

- UX microcopy like help text, form field names or error messages
- Longer-form copy like terms and conditions or instructions
- Emails that are part of a product experience
- This guide is primarily for anyone writing customer-facing copy in SN Digital.

If there's a topic we need to cover, or an example that needs updating, talk to Gaynor Burns.

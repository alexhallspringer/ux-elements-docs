# Introduction

Use these content guidelines when you’re writing content for Springer Nature’s digital services. This includes things like:
- UX microcopy, like button labels, error messages, link text etc.
- Longer form UX copy, like information about a service, terms and conditions etc.
- Communications, like emails

It does not include journals and articles, which have their own content guidelines.
## Who is this guidance for?

We don’t have a big content design team here at Springer Nature (yet) - so it’s important that anyone who’s working on our digital products is comfortable with the basics.

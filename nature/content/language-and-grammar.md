# Language and Grammar
## Use these rules to keep our writing clear and consistent. This applies to all public facing content.


### Avoid common mistakes 

Split infinitives are often seen as grammatical mistakes by traditionalists. They occur when other words creep into the middle of an English infinitive, e.g. 

Do | Don't
------ | ------
To reply quickly    | To quickly reply  
To assess adequately   | To adequately asses  

### Logging in and out

Remember that ‘login’ is the noun and ‘log in’ is the verb. So:

* You need your login details to log in at the login.
* You can also log out at the login.

### Use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

If you need to refer to a particular time of day, make sure you use the 24-hour clock together with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example: 18.00 UTC.

### Keep things consistent

Some words or grammatical constructions have different forms that aren’t necessarily right or wrong. However, we should be consistent with those that we use:

* Manuscript titles should appear in “double inverted commas”, not ‘single ones’.
* Headlines and buttons should be written in sentence case. Not in Initial Capitals.
* We send emails, not e-mails.
* Don’t forget the hyphen in our new peer-review system.
* When emailing EBMs, we should include their title and last name if possible.
* If we don’t have the EBM’s title, we should include their first name and last name.
* When sending emails from EBMs, we include their title, first name and last name if we have them.
* Reviewers write reports, not reviews.
* Use solid black bullets like the ones here. 
* Although we generally refer to reviewers, they are also known as referees.

### Use capitals only when appropriate

We should only use initial capitals when referring to a specific person, job title or thing, such as:
* Editorial Board Member
* Editor
* Reviewer Finder
* Peer Review Advisors
* Article Processing Charge
* Quality Check

### Words that remain lowercase 

We shouldn’t use capitals when referring to more general items, such as:

* peer-review system 
* reviewer
* manuscript
* submission
* paper
* author

### Keep paragraphs short

Research has shown that dense content puts off most users. For those whose first language isn’t English, long sentences and paragraphs can be even more confusing. 

Putting key sentences in a paragraph of their own will help deliver the message and make the sentences easier to understand.

### Keep sentences even shorter

As with paragraphs, sentences should also be short and to the point. A sentence with several clauses may work better as several sentences.

Too many ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’ can make the content harder to understand. The same is true with words like ‘however’, ‘unless’, ‘neither’ and ‘only if’.  The more you use them, the more likely it is that users will misinterpret what you have written.  

### Manuscript, Paper, Submission or Assignment?

As is often the case, our use of words depends on the context. ‘Manuscript’ and ‘paper’ are interchangeable in many instances and it sometimes helps to have two words at your disposal rather than one.

The same goes for ‘submission’ and ‘assignment’ when talking to EBMs. Although the words don’t have the same meaning, they can often be used interchangeably to avoid repetition.

However, when creating the UI or specific user instructions, consistency is key. Here we should only ever use ‘manuscript’ or ‘submission’, depending on which is relevant. Please bear in mind that a manuscript is one part of the submission, so the two aren’t interchangeable.

### Beware when using the word ‘country’

Many places that are regularly referred to as countries are not universally recognised as such. Therefore, describing those places as countries is extremely contentious. 
In tables, lists, and drop-down menus used to collect information about readers, authors, referees and customers, the best alternative is ‘location’ instead.  But ‘country/region’, ‘country/territory’, or 'jurisdiction' are also acceptable.
In written text, finding an alternative that doesn't seem inelegant or forced is more difficult, but the principle still applies. Find another way of writing what you want to say. Or find other words, like ‘places’, ‘jurisdictions’ or ‘parts of the world’.

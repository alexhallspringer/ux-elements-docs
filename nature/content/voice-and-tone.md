# Voice and Tone
Please use this style guide alongside the Nature Portfolio Tone of Voice Handout. It follows the same principles as the handout but adds some more specific details and examples.

### Conversational tone

When writing for an academic publishing company, it can be tempting to use complex, formal wording that we often associate with scholarly language. 

However, such a writing style is likely to make us sound rigid and aloof when our aim is to come across as human and approachable. 

So, instead of a formal, written style, we use a conversational style. We write as we speak.  

One thing we do when speaking, that we don’t always do when writing, is related to sentence structure: 

### We use the active rather than the passive voice 

Passive voice: Your nature.com account must be created with the name@gmail.com email address.

Active voice: Please create your nature.com account with your name@gmail.com email address.

### Tips for creating conversational writing 

1. Just say it 
Imagine the user or recipient is standing right in front of you, how would you tell them? Try to be as natural and spontaneous as you can, without processing or structuring beforehand. Get someone to ask you what you mean – and reply with the first answer that comes to mind. 

2. Ask questions 
Instead of the error message, “Please check your login details”, you could say “Have you logged in correctly?” This not only sounds more conversational and friendly but is more likely to elicit a response as we don’t like to leave a question unanswered. 

### Choose less formal wording

One way to make sure our writing sounds more conversational is to replace formal words with more normal ones - the sort we’d use ourselves every day: 

Casual				Formal	
~~Normal~~ 		 ~~… not formal~~

Titled			… not entitled  
Make sure		… not ensure
Need			… not require
On/about		… not regarding
Follow			… not adhere to
Able to			… not in a position to
Help			… not assistance
Start			… not commence
Let			… not enable
More			… not further
But			… not however
To			… not in order to
Get			… not obtain
Give			… not provide
Question		… not query
Fix			… not resolve
So			… not therefore
Use 			… not utilise

We’re not talking about banning any words. But if you find you’re using words frequently from the right hand column, try replacing them with words from the left and see how they can lift the tone of voice.

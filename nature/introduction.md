## Nature Portfolio


Nature Portfolio is here to serve the research community by publishing its most significant discoveries - findings that advance knowledge and address some of the greatest challenges that we face as a society today. Our journals publish primary research, reviews, critical comment, news and analysis.  

This toolkit will ultimately provide you with:

- Our styleguide and principles that define the Nature Portfolio digital brand with guidelines on accessibility, layout, typography, and iconography amongst others
- Components that are used on Nature Portfolio branded products that can be consumed or copied for your products
- Patterns for common tasks that our users do on our sites. These may be a combination of components and style guidelines
- Guidance on how to write content that is more conversational and concise for our audiences.


It is a work in progress and content will be added continuously. If you wish to contribute to any of the styleguide, components or patterns, or just want some more information please contact elements@springernature.com.

# Design Princples
**1.** **Reducing everything to the essential.** We believe that every element on our pages should be supporting the needs and goals of our users. These goals vary from wanting to discover relevant content, to finding information that will help them decide whether to submit to the journal. For much of last year, the team has been  [improving the Information Architecture](https://hive.springernature.com/home/designing-a-new-information-architecture-for-the-nature-journal-websites)  (IA) of our content, leading to an improved restructuring of information. This holistic overview has enabled us to re-organise the homepage, removing redundant sections and consolidating groups of content  [into the new menu](https://hive.springernature.com/home/ls/community/content-consumption/post/4537888966049792) . A more focused design will help people find the information they’re looking for as quickly as possible.


**2.** **Colours are secondary, never dominant.** Following the Nature flagship’s lead, we communicate principally in black and white. Colour can be used as an accent, such as the journal’s identity or to help guide the eye to new information and policy messages. The focus is on our world-leading content, presented on a clean background. And it allows our beautiful custom typeface, Harding to truly shine.


**3.** **A logical information hierarchy.** Our aim is clear and direct communication. Led by @Cleo Ngiam, we’ve run many collaborative sessions with journal editors to understand how the structure of the page can be best laid out, making sure that the styling, scale and positioning of elements always reflect the information hierarchy. The top sections now use a more modern image aspect ratio which will be easier for our art teams to produce for, and there will be further improvements to make better use of this space.


**4.** **Directing the eye around our content.** We know from previous testing that our readers  [focus on scanning headlines and looking for keywords](https://hive.springernature.com/home/improving-the-user-experience-on-nature-collections) . Using an asymmetrical layout helps break down the article information to separate columns, with primary information (headlines) in the middle of the screen, and all secondary elements to the left/right. This allows the reader’s eye to jump quickly from headline to headline and focus on publication dates when looking at primary research. The layout on small screen devices is also more compact than the old design, with more articles in view per screen.  


**5.** **A system-based approach**. Grids are the foundation of a logical and systematic approach to layout. They enable us to apply consistency and rationality across a wide range of formats and media. We’ve re-used many of the same design patterns from the flagship, as well as building new ones for different journal types such as the review journals and broad-scope journals. The next step will be writing design documentation and style guides that help teams across the business apply the new branding consistently for all our products.

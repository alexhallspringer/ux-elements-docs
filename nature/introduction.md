## Nature Portfolio

Welcome to the toolkit for products under the Nature Portfolio brand.

Nature Portfolio is here to serve the research community by publishing its most significant discoveries - findings that advance knowledge and address some of the greatest challenges that we face as a society today. Our journals publish primary research, reviews, critical comment, news and analysis.  

This toolkit will ultimately provide you with:

- a styleguide that defines the Nature Portfolio digital brand with guidelines on accessibility, layout, typography, ands iconography amongst others.
- a set of components that are used on Nature Portfolio branded products that can be consumed or copied for your products
- a set of patterns for common tasks that our users do on our sites. These may be a combination of components and style guidelines


It is a work in progress and content will be added continuously. If you wish to contribute to any of the styleguide, components or patterns, or just want some more information please contact elements@springernature.com.

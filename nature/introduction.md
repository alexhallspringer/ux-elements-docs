## Nature Portfolio

Welcome to the toolkit for products under the Nature Portfolio brand.

Nature Portfolio is here to serve the research community by publishing its most significant discoveries - findings that advance knowledge and address some of the greatest challenges that we face as a society today. Our journals publish primary research, reviews, critical comment, news and analysis.  

This toolkit will ultimately provide you with:

- Our styleguide and princples that define the Nature Portfolio digital brand with guidelines on accessibility, layout, typography, and iconography amongst others
- Components that are used on Nature Portfolio branded products that can be consumed or copied for your products
- Patterns for common tasks that our users do on our sites. These may be a combination of components and style guidelines
- Guidance on how to write content that is more conversational and concise for our audiences.


It is a work in progress and content will be added continuously. If you wish to contribute to any of the styleguide, components or patterns, or just want some more information please contact elements@springernature.com.

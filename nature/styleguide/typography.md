# Typography

## Font Families


### Harding
We use our custom typeface, Harding as our primary font for headings and the main body text. Named after the late neurologist Anita Harding, it was designed specifically for science, with a large range of special characters for different subjects.

A key consideration in Harding’s overall design is performance on small digital screens. To boost readability in a limited space, it helps to enlarge the main portion of the lower-case letters, while making the ascenders and descenders (as in ‘h’ and ‘g’, respectively) smaller. Ultimately, this renders long, complex strings of words easier to parse, and allows for neat stacking of lengthy technical research-article titles over a number of lines.

Harding creates an overall impression of calm, rational intelligence with perhaps a dash of British formality and wit.

### System fonts
We use system fonts or “native typography” for elements that are interactive, such as buttons, forms and navigation links. We also use it for secondary information such as meta data, author names, publication dates and article summaries.

Using system fonts ensure our websites can perform well on slow connection speeds, creating a more frictionless experience. Fonts native to the users’ OS, such as Apple’s SF Pro and Microsoft’s Segoe UI are also well optimised for legibility.


## Usage

### Headings
Use our font styles consistently by always making sure they reflect the information hierarchy on the page. If the hierarchy is clear, we ensure that our content is easily scannable for our audiences. Combining these font sizes and styles together with layouts designed for optimal reading experiences will foster familiarity for our users.

* In hero cards and headings, harding works best when character spacing and line height are tight
* Longer article text should use line height to maximise legibility
* Body text and paragraphs at base sizes should not exceed 800px in width

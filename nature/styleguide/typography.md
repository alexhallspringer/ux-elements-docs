### Harding
We use our custom typeface, Harding as our primary font for headings and the main body text. Named after the late neurologist Anita Harding, it was designed specifically for science, with a large range of special characters for different subjects.

A key consideration in Harding’s overall design is performance on small digital screens. To boost readability in a limited space, it helps to enlarge the main portion of the lower-case letters, while making the ascenders and descenders (as in ‘h’ and ‘g’, respectively) smaller. Ultimately, this renders long, complex strings of words easier to parse, and allows for neat stacking of lengthy technical research-article titles over a number of lines.

Harding creates an overall impression of calm, rational intelligence with perhaps a dash of British formality and wit.

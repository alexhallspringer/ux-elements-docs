# Typography

 <br />
 
## Font Families

 <br />
 
### Georgia
We use Georgia as our primary typeface for headings and the main body text. Georgia is pre-installed most personal computers so it does not

### System fonts
We use system fonts or “native typography” for elements that are interactive, such as buttons, forms and navigation links. We also use it for secondary information such as meta data, author names, publication dates and article summaries.

Using system fonts ensure our websites can perform well on slow connection speeds, creating a more frictionless experience. Fonts native to the users’ OS, such as Apple’s SF Pro and Microsoft’s Segoe UI are also well optimised for legibility.

## Usage

Use our font styles consistently by always making sure they reflect the information hierarchy on the page. If the hierarchy is clear, we ensure that our content is easily scannable for our audiences. Combining these font sizes and styles together with layouts designed for optimal reading experiences will foster familiarity for our users.

* In hero cards and headings, harding works best when character spacing and line height are tight
* Longer article text should use line height to maximise legibility
* Body text and paragraphs at base sizes should not exceed 800px in width
* We use fluid typography by applying properties for different screen sizes, "Max" and "Min"

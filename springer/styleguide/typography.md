# Typography

## Font Families

 <br />
 
### Georgia
Georgia is a serif typeface designed to be legible on low res screens. It is Springer's primary digital typeface, used for main body text and headings. As a web safe font, Georgia is pre-installed on most modern operating systems, ensuring a consistent display on any device. This also benefits the user experience as it saves performance time in the browser.

### System fonts
We use system fonts or “native typography” for elements that are interactive, such as buttons, forms and navigation links. We also use it for secondary information such as meta data, author names, publication dates and article summaries.

Using system fonts ensure our websites can perform well on slow connection speeds, creating a more frictionless experience. Sans-serif fonts that are native to the users’ OS, include Apple’s SF Pro and Microsoft’s Segoe UI and are well optimised for legibility.

## Principles and usage

Use our font styles consistently by always making sure they reflect the information hierarchy on the page. If the hierarchy is clear, we ensure that our content is easily scannable for our audiences. Combining these font sizes and styles together with layouts designed for optimal reading experiences will foster familiarity for our users. 

Follow these principles to ensure a comfortable reading experience:

* Georgia's bold weight is very heavy so it should be limited in its use.
* Longer article text should use generous line height to maximise legibility
* Body text and paragraphs at base sizes should not exceed 800px in line width
* We use fluid typography by applying properties for different screen sizes, "Max" and "Min"

# Typography

## Font Families

 <br />
 
### Georgia
We use Georgia as our primary typeface for headings and the main body text. Georgia is pre-installed most personal computers so it does not

### System fonts
We use system fonts or “native typography” for elements that are interactive, such as buttons, forms and navigation links. We also use it for secondary information such as meta data, author names, publication dates and article summaries.

Using system fonts ensure our websites can perform well on slow connection speeds, creating a more frictionless experience. Fonts native to the users’ OS, such as Apple’s SF Pro and Microsoft’s Segoe UI are also well optimised for legibility.

## Principles and usage

Use our font styles consistently by always making sure they reflect the information hierarchy on the page. If the hierarchy is clear, we ensure that our content is easily scannable for our audiences. Combining these font sizes and styles together with layouts designed for optimal reading experiences will foster familiarity for our users. 

Follow these principles to ensure a comfortable reading experience:

* Georgia's bold weight is very heavy so it should be limited in its use.
* Longer article text should use generous line height to maximise legibility
* Body text and paragraphs at base sizes should not exceed 800px in line width
* We use fluid typography by applying properties for different screen sizes, "Max" and "Min"

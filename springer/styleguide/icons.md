# Icons

Icons should symbolise a single meaning or direction and shouldn’t be ornamental. They are designed to be simple, friendly and readable at small sizes. Use them to support key actions and signposting.

For marketing use, we rely on our corporate icon library to source product icons for illustrative purposes and to help add context. These should follow the product’s colour accent, to blend in with the surrounding interface.


Icons:
* are 24×24, 32×32 or 48x48 px in size
* are within a 24 × 24 px bounding box 
* use a 1 px stroke weight

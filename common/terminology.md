#h2 Pattern 

A high-level solution to a common design problem. May use multiple components put together in different ways. Generally, a basis for solving a design problem, not a prescriptive solution.

A pattern will generally be used to help a user solve a task in a universal way. They can't be described by a component because they are too complex or apply too broadly. Patterns can be composed of components from the system. Patterns can also be applied to components (for example applying anchor link styling conventions to a component)

**Examples: tabs, video controls, checkout steps, article page, journal homepage, anchor link conventions**

#h2 Component 

Specific chunks of the UI that can be put together to compose a page. Each component is prescriptive and has a specific role. Components can be grouped to form other components. They can also be put together to form a Pattern that applies universally. They may also have pattern conventions applied to them (for example the interaction behaviour of 'disabled states' in a form input)

**Examples: card, footer, banner, header**

#h2 Package

A block of code representing a component or some global code that can be installed in a product application through NPM

**Examples: article view, Nature CSS context, Global CSS utilities, springer-card**
